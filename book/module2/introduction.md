# Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Introduction

Module 2 focuses on creating and working with digital twins of robots using simulation environments. A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical robot that allows for testing, development, and validation without the need for physical hardware. This module covers two major simulation platforms: Gazebo for physics-based simulation and Unity for high-fidelity visualization.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Set up and configure Gazebo simulation environments
- Create realistic physics properties for robot simulation
- Work with URDF and SDF robot description formats
- Implement sensor simulation (LiDAR, Depth Cameras, IMUs) in Gazebo
- Create Unity visualizations for robots
- Integrate ROS 2 with simulated environments
- Validate robot behavior in simulation before physical deployment

## Overview

Simulation is a critical component of modern robotics development. It allows developers to:
- Test algorithms without risk of damaging hardware
- Experiment with different scenarios quickly
- Validate robot behavior before deployment
- Train machine learning models in safe environments
- Demonstrate robot capabilities without physical hardware

This module will cover both Gazebo, which provides accurate physics simulation, and Unity, which provides high-quality visualization and rendering capabilities.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals)
- Basic understanding of physics concepts (mass, inertia, friction)
- Familiarity with 3D modeling concepts
- Basic knowledge of robot sensors and their functions
