# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Introduction

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book. In this module, we'll explore the Robot Operating System (ROS 2), which serves as the nervous system for robots. ROS 2 provides the communication infrastructure that allows different components of a robot to work together seamlessly.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the fundamental concepts of ROS 2 architecture
- Create and run ROS 2 nodes using Python
- Implement topics, services, and actions for robot communication
- Structure ROS 2 packages effectively
- Interface with sensors and actuators

## Overview

ROS 2 is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It's a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robot platforms.

Unlike traditional software architectures, ROS 2 uses a distributed system where different parts of your robot's software run as separate processes (nodes) that communicate with each other through messages passed over topics, services, and actions.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of fundamental robotics concepts
- Completed the setup from the introduction
