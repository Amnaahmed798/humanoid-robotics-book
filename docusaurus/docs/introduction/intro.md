# Introduction

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book. This comprehensive guide covers the development of autonomous humanoid robots using ROS 2, NVIDIA Isaac, and AI technologies.

This book is organized into four comprehensive modules:

1. The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
2. Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
3. The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)
4. Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Each module builds upon the previous one to provide a complete understanding of humanoid robotics development.
