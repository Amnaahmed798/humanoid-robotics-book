# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

Welcome to the comprehensive guide to developing autonomous humanoid robots using ROS 2, NVIDIA Isaac, and AI technologies.

## About This Book

This book covers the complete stack for humanoid robotics development:

- **Module 1**: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - Learn about ROS 2 architecture, Python integration, launch files, URDF for humanoid robots, and sensor/actuator interfaces.

- **Module 2**: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) - Explore simulation environments, physics properties, sensor simulation, and visualization techniques.

- **Module 3**: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac) - Discover Isaac SDK, Visual SLAM, synthetic data generation, reinforcement learning, and sim-to-real transfer techniques.

- **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) - Implement multi-modal interaction systems, voice commands, cognitive planning, and the capstone autonomous humanoid project.
