Created a comprehensive task breakdown for the RAG chatbot backend implementation with 75 specific tasks organized across 6 phases:

1. Phase 1: Setup (7 tasks) - Project initialization and basic structure
2. Phase 2: Foundational Components (12 tasks) - Models, services, and core functionality
3. Phase 3: User Story 1 - RAG Chatbot Content Retrieval (8 tasks) - Search functionality (P1 priority)
4. Phase 4: User Story 2 - Content Extraction and Processing (22 tasks) - Full pipeline (P2 priority)
5. Phase 5: User Story 3 - Embedding Validation and Quality Assurance (11 tasks) - Validation features (P3 priority)
6. Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns (15 tasks) - Final improvements and testing

All tasks follow the required checklist format with:

- User Story labels: [US1], [US2], [US3] for user story tasks
- Clear descriptions with specific file paths
- Proper organization by user story priority (P1, P2, P3)

The MVP scope includes User Story 1 (RAG Chatbot Content Retrieval) which provides the core value proposition of enabling users to ask questions and receive relevant answers from the book content.
